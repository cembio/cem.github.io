 abstract = {Temperature influences the activities of living organisms at various levels. Cells not only detect environmental temperature changes through their unique temperature-sensitive molecular machineries but also muster an appropriate response to the temperature change to maintain their inherent functions. Despite the fundamental involvement of temperature in physiological phenomena, the mechanism by which cells produce and use heat is largely unknown. Recently, fluorescent thermosensors that function as thermometers in live cells have attracted much attention in biology. These new tools, made of various temperaturesensitive molecules, have allowed for intracellular thermometry at the single-cell level. Intriguing spatiotemporal temperature variations, including organelle-specific thermogenesis, have been revealed with these fluorescent thermosensors, which suggest an intrinsic connection between temperature and cell functions. Moreover, fluorescent thermosensors have shown that intracellular temperature changes at the microscopic level are largely different from those assumed for a water environment at the macroscopic level. Thus, the employment of fluorescent thermosensors will uncover novel mechanisms of intracellular temperature-assisted physiological functions.},
