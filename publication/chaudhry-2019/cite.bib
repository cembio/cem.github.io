 abstract = {ABSTRACT

Live-cell imaging of mitochondrial function and dynamics can provide vital insights into both physiology and pathophysiology, including of metabolic diseases like type 2 diabetes. However, without super-resolution microscopy and commercial analysis software it is challenging to accurately extract features from dense multi-layered mitochondrial networks, such as those in insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells. Motivated by this, we developed a comprehensive pipeline, and associated ImageJ plugin, that enables 2D/3D quantification of mitochondrial network morphology and dynamics in mouse β-cells, and by extension other similarly challenging cell-types. The approach is based on standard confocal microscopy and shareware, making it widely accessible. The pipeline was validated using mitochondrial photo-labelling and unsupervised cluster analysis, and is capable of morphological and functional analyses on a per-organelle basis, including in 4D (

). Overall, this tool offers a powerful framework for multiplexed analysis of mitochondrial state/function, and provides a valuable resource to accelerate mitochondrial research in health and disease.},
