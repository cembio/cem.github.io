 abstract = {Calcium ions (Ca2+) are some of the most versatile signalling molecules, and they have many physiological functions, prominently including muscle contraction, neuronal excitability$â€Š$, cell migration and cell growth. By sequestering and releasing Ca2+, mitochondria serve as important regulators of cellular Ca2+. Mitochondrial Ca2+ also has other important functions, such as regulation of mitochondrial metabolism, ATP production and cell death. In recent years, identification of the molecular machinery regulating mitochondrial Ca2+ accumulation and efflux has expanded the number of (patho)physiological conditions that rely on mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis. Thus, expanding the understanding of the mechanisms of mitochondrial Ca2+ regulation and function in different cell types is an important task in biomedical research, which offers the possibility of targeting mitochondrial Ca2+ machinery for the treatment of several disorders.},
