 abstract = {Mitochondria are organelles of endosymbiotic origin, surrounded by two membranes. The inner membrane forms invaginations called cristae that enhance its surface and are important for mitochondrial function. A recently described mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system (MICOS) in the inner mitochondrial membrane is crucial for the formation and maintenance of cristae structure. The MICOS complex in human mitochondria exhibits specificities and greater complexity in comparison to the yeast system. Many subunits of this complex have been previously described, but several others and their function remain to be explored. This review will summarize our present knowledge about the human MICOS complex and its constituents, while discussing the future research perspectives in this exciting and important field.},
