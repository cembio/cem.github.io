 abstract = {Graphics processing units (GPU) allow image processing at unprecedented speed. We present CLIJ, a Fiji plugin enabling end-users with entry level experience in programming to benefit from GPU-accelerated image processing. Freely programmable workflows can sped up image processing in Fiji by factor 10 and more using high-end GPU hardware and on affordable mobile computers with built-in GPUs.},
