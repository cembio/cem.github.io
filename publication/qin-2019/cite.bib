 abstract = {Organoids are powerful biomimetic tissue models. Despite their widespread adoption, methods to analyse cell-type specific post-translational modification (PTM) signalling networks in organoids are absent. Here we report multivariate single-cell analysis of cell-type specific signalling networks in organoids and organoid co-cultures. Simultaneous measurement of 28 PTMs in $>$1 million single small intestinal organoid cells by mass cytometry reveals cell-type and cell-state specific signalling networks in stem, Paneth, enteroendocrine, tuft, goblet cells, and enterocytes. Integrating single-cell PTM analysis with Thiol-reactive Organoid Barcoding

cell-autonomously mimic signalling states normally induced by stromal fibroblasts and macrophages. These results demonstrate how standard mass cytometry workflows can be modified to perform high-throughput multivariate cell-type specific signalling analysis of healthy and cancerous organoids.},
