The mitochondrial inner membrane can reshape under different physiological conditions. How and at which frequency this occurs
in vivo
and what are the molecular players involved is unknown. Here we show using state-of-the-art live-cell stimulated emission depletion (STED) super-resolution nanoscopy that crista junctions (CJs) are dynamically fusing and dividing in a reversible and balanced manner at a timescale of seconds. CJ dynamics is strongly reduced in the absence of the MICOS subunit MIC13. Staining of the cristae membrane using different protein markers or two inner mitochondrial membrane-specific dyes revealed that cristae also undergo continuous cycles of fusion and fission. These processes are dependent on MIC13 and occur at a timescale of seconds, resembling CJ dynamics. Our data further suggest that MIC60 acts as a docking platform pioneering CJ formation. Overall, by employing a variety of advanced imaging techniques including FRAP (Fluorescence-Recovery-After Photobleaching), SPT (Single-Particle-Tracking), live-cell STED and confocal Airyscan microscopy we demonstrate that cristae undergo continuous cycles of fusion and fission in a manner that is mechanistically linked to CJ formation and dynamics.},
