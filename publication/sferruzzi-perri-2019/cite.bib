 abstract = {Mitochondria respond to a range of stimuli and function in energy production and redox homeostasis. However, little is known about the developmental and environmental control of mitochondria in the placenta, an organ vital for fetal growth and pregnancy maintenance in eutherian mammals. Using respirometry and molecular analyses, the present study examined mitochondrial function in the distinct transport and endocrine zones of the mouse placenta during normal pregnancy and maternal inhalation hypoxia. The data show that mitochondria of the two zones adopt different strategies in modulating their respiration, substrate use, biogenesis, density, and efficiency to best support the growth and energy demands of fetoplacental tissues during late gestation in both normal and hypoxic conditions. The findings have important implications for environmentally induced adaptations in mitochondrial function in other tissues and for compromised human pregnancy in which hypoxia and alterations in placental mitochondrial function are associated with poor outcomes like fetal growth restriction.},
