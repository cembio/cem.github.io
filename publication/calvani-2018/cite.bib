 abstract = {The early phases of embryonic development and cancer share similar strategies to improve their survival in an inhospitable environment: both proliferate in a hypoxic and catecholamine-rich context, increasing aerobic glycolysis. Recent studies show that
β
3-adrenergic receptor (
β
3-AR) is involved in tumor progression, playing an important role in metastasis. Among
β
-adrenergic receptors,
β
3-AR is the last identified member of this family, and it is involved in cancer cell survival and induction of stromal reactivity in the tumor microenvironment.
β
3-AR is well known as a strong activator of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown fat tissue. Interestingly,
β
3-AR is strongly expressed in early embryo development and in many cancer tissues. Induction of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) has been related to cancer metabolic switch, leading to accelerated glycolysis and reduced mitochondrial activity. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate that
β
3-AR is able to promote this metabolic shift in both cancer and embryonic stem cells, inducing specific glycolytic cytoplasmic enzymes and a sort of mitochondrial dormancy through the induction of UCP2. The
β
3-AR/UCP2 axis induces a strong reduction of mitochondrial activity by reducing ATP synthesis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) content. These effects are reverted by SR59230A, the specific
β
3-AR antagonist, causing an increase in mtROS. The increased level of mtROS is neutralized by a strong antioxidant activity in embryonic stem cells, but not in cancer stem cells, where it causes a dramatic reduction in tumor cell viability. These results lead to the possibility of a selective antitumor therapeutic use of SR59230A. Notably, we demonstrate the presence of
β
3-AR within the mitochondrial membrane in both cell lines, leading to the control of mitochondrial dormancy.},
