 abstract = {The growing focus on brown adipocytes has spurred an interest in their potential benefits for metabolic diseases. Brown and beige (or brite) adipocytes express high levels of uncoupling protein 1 (Ucp1) to dissipate heat instead of generating ATP. Ucp1 induction by stimuli including cold, exercise, and diet increases nonshivering thermogenesis, leading to increased energy expenditure and prevention of obesity. Recently, studies in adipocytes have indicated the existence of functional Ucp1‐independent thermogenic regulators. Furthermore, substrate cycling involving creatine metabolites, cold‐induced N‐acyl amino acids, and oxidized lipids in white adipocytes can increase energy expenditure in the absence of Ucp1. These studies emphasize the need for a better understanding of the mechanisms governing energy expenditure in adipocytes and their potential applications in the prevention of human obesity and metabolic diseases.},
