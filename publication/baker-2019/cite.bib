 abstract = {The dynamic and fluid nature of mitochondria allows for modifications in mitochondrial shape, connectivity and cristae architecture. The precise balance of mitochondrial dynamics is among the most critical features in the control of mitochondrial function. In the past few years, mitochondrial shape has emerged as a key regulatory factor in the determination of the bioenergetic capacity of cells. This is mostly due to the recent discoveries linking changes in cristae organization with supercomplex assembly of the electron transport chain (ETC), also defined as the formation of respirosomes. Here we will review the most current advances demonstrating the impact of mitochondrial dynamics and cristae shape on oxidative metabolism, respiratory efficiency, and redox state. Furthermore, we will discuss the implications of mitochondrial dynamics and supercomplex assembly under physiological and pathological conditions.},
