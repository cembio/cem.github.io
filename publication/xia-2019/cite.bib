 abstract = {Mitochondria are energy factories of cells and are important pivots for intracellular interactions with other organelles. They interact with the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, and nucleus through signal transduction, vesicle transport, and membrane contact sites to regulate energy metabolism, biosynthesis, immune response, and cell turnover. However, when the communication between organelles fails and the mitochondria are dysfunctional, it may induce tumorigenesis. In this review, we elaborate on how mitochondria interact with the endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, and cell nuclei, as well as the relation between organelle communication and tumor development .},
