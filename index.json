Biogenesis, maintenance, and functions of mitochondria require correct assembly of resident proteins and lipids, which require their transport into and within mitochondria. Mitochondrial normal functions also require an exchange of small metabolites between the cytosol and mitochondria, which is primarily mediated by a metabolite channel of the outer membrane (OM) called porin or voltage-dependent anion channel. Here, we describe recently revealed novel roles of porin in the mitochondrial protein and lipid transport. First, porin regulates the formation of the mitochondrial protein import gate in the OM, the translocase of the outer membrane (TOM) complex, and its dynamic exchange between the major form of a trimer and the minor form of a dimer. The TOM complex dimer lacks a core subunit Tom22 and mediates the import of a subset of mitochondrial proteins while the TOM complex trimer facilitates the import of most other mitochondrial proteins. Second, porin interacts with both a translocating inner membrane (IM) protein like a carrier protein accumulated at the small TIM chaperones in the intermembrane space and the TIM22 complex, a downstream translocator in the IM for the carrier protein import. Porin thereby facilitates the efficient transfer of carrier proteins to the IM during their import. Third, porin facilitates the transfer of lipids between the OM and IM and promotes a back-up pathway for the cardiolipin synthesis in mitochondria. Thus, porin has roles more than the metabolite transport in the protein and lipid transport into and within mitochondria, which is likely conserved from yeast to human.","tags":null,"title":"Multifaceted Roles of Porin in Mitochondrial Protein and Lipid Transport","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jervis Vermal Thevathasan","Maurice Kahnwald","Konstanty Cieśliński","Philipp Hoess","Sudheer Kumar Peneti","Manuel Reitberger","Daniel Heid","Krishna Chaitanya Kasuba","Sarah Janice Hoerner","Yiming Li","Yu-Le Wu","Markus Mund","Ulf Matti","Pedro Matos Pereira","Ricardo Henriques","Bianca Nijmeijer","Moritz Kueblbeck","Vilma Jimenez Sabinina","Jan Ellenberg","Jonas Ries"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"31747ded71c77851b425aa3a0e8069e5","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/thevathasan-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.738743Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thevathasan-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Nuclear Pores as Versatile Reference Standards for Quantitative Superresolution Microscopy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Magdalena Wagner","Masahito Yoshihara","Iyadh Douagi","Anastasios Damdimopoulos","Sarita Panula","Sophie Petropoulos","Haojiang Lu","Karin Pettersson","Kerstin Palm","Shintaro Katayama","Outi Hovatta","Juha Kere","Fredrik Lanner","Pauliina Damdimopoulou"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"1c40ea694489e26ecdb1f3db3e7d3e3b","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/wagner-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.784073Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wagner-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"ABSTRACT The human ovary orchestrates sex hormone production and undergoes monthly structural changes to release mature oocytes. The outer lining of the ovary (cortex) has a key role in defining fertility in women as it harbors the ovarian reserve. It has been postulated that putative oogonial stem cells exist in the ovarian cortex and that these can be captured by DDX4 antibody isolation. We analysed on a single cell level the transcriptome and cell surface antigen profiles of over 24,000 cells from high quality ovarian cortex samples from 21 patients. Our single cell mapping reveals transcriptional profiles of six main cell types; oocytes, granulosa cells, immune cells, endothelial cells, perivascular cells, and stromal cells. Cells captured by DDX4 antibody are perivascular cells, not oogonial stem cells. Our data does not support the existence of germline stem cells in adult human ovaries thereby reinforcing the dogma of a limited ovarian reserve.","tags":null,"title":"Single Cell Map of the Human Ovarian Cortex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Arun Kumar Kondadi","Ruchika Anand","Andreas S.

Although they are frequently depicted as static bean-shaped structures, our view has markedly changed over the past few decades as many studies have revealed a remarkable dynamicity of mitochondrial shapes and sizes both at the cellular and intra-mitochondrial levels. Aberrant changes in mitochondrial dynamics and cristae structure are associated with ageing and numerous human diseases (e.g., cancer, diabetes, various neurodegenerative diseases, types of neuro- and myopathies). Another unique feature of mitochondria is that they harbor their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). MtDNA exists in several hundreds to thousands of copies per cell and is arranged and packaged in the mitochondrial matrix in structures termed mt-nucleoids. Many human diseases are mechanistically linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and alteration of the number and/or the integrity of mtDNA. In particular, several recent studies identified remarkable and partly unexpected links between mitochondrial structure, fusion and fission dynamics, and mtDNA. In this review, we will provide an overview about these recent insights and aim to clarify how mitochondrial dynamics, cristae ultrastructure and mtDNA structure influence each other and determine mitochondrial functions.","tags":null,"title":"Functional Interplay between Cristae Biogenesis, Mitochondrial Dynamics and Mitochondrial DNA Integrity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Isabel Gordaliza‐Alaguero","Carlos Cantó","Antonio Zorzano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"8d2430c8e8e329b599937e68dce02a3e","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/gordaliza-alaguero-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.744284Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gordaliza-alaguero-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Cellular organelles are not static but show dynamism—a property that is likely relevant for their function. In addition, they interact with other organelles in a highly dynamic manner. In this review, we analyze the proteins involved in the interaction between mitochondria and other cellular organelles, especially the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid droplets, and lysosomes. Recent results indicate that, on one hand, metabolic alterations perturb the interaction between mitochondria and other organelles, and, on the other hand, that deficiency in proteins involved in the tethering between mitochondria and the ER or in specific functions of the interaction leads to metabolic alterations in a variety of tissues. The interaction between organelles is an emerging field that will permit to identify key proteins, to delineate novel modulation pathways, and to elucidate their implications in human disease.","tags":null,"title":"Metabolic Implications of Organelle–Mitochondria Communication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jung Dae Kim","Nal Ae Yoon","Sungho Jin","Sabrina Diano"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1567296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567296000,"objectID":"dcd6be900c23397b69fc2b6298c366e9","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/kim-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.745618Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kim-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Microglia play a crucial role in immune responses, including inflammation.

The intracellular mechanism(s) responsible for HFDinduced microglia activation is ill defined. Here, we show that in vivo, HFD induced a rapid and transient increase in uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) mRNA expression together with changes in mitochondrial dynamics. Selective microglial deletion of Ucp2 prevented changes in mitochondrial dynamics and function, microglia activation, and hypothalamic inflammation. In association with these, male and female mice were protected from HFD-induced obesity, showing decreased feeding and increased energy expenditure that were associated with changes in the synaptic input organization and activation of the anorexigenic hypothalamic POMC neurons and astrogliosis. Together, our data point to a fuel-availabilitydriven mitochondrial mechanism as a major player of microglia activation in the central regulation of DIO.","tags":null,"title":"Microglial UCP2 Mediates Inflammation and Obesity Induced by High-Fat Feeding","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lucas von Chamier","Romain F.

This progress has been facilitated by approaching each fluorophore iteratively with the probing doughnut minimum, making the resolution essentially uniform and isotropic over scalable fields of view. MINFLUX imaging of nuclear pore complexes of a mammalian cell shows that this true nanometer scale resolution is obtained in three dimensions and in two color channels.

Motivated by this, we developed a comprehensive pipeline, and associated ImageJ plugin, that enables 2D/3D quantification of mitochondrial network morphology and dynamics in mouse β-cells, and by extension other similarly challenging cell-types. The approach is based on standard confocal microscopy and shareware, making it widely accessible. The pipeline was validated using mitochondrial photo-labelling and unsupervised cluster analysis, and is capable of morphological and functional analyses on a per-organelle basis, including in 4D ( xyzt ).

Blood flow along the lobule radial axis creates gradients of oxygen, nutrients and hormones, which, together with morphogenetic fields, give rise to a highly variable microenvironment. In line with this spatial variability$ $, key liver functions are expressed non-uniformly across the lobules, a phenomenon termed zonation. Technologies based on single-cell transcriptomics have constructed a global spatial map of hepatocyte gene expression in mice revealing that ~50% of hepatocyte genes are expressed in a zonated manner. This broad spatial heterogeneity suggests that hepatocytes in different lobule zones might have not only different gene expression profiles but also distinct epigenetic features, regenerative capacities, susceptibilities to damage and other functional aspects. Here, we present genomic approaches for studying liver zonation, describe the principles of liver zonation and discuss the intrinsic and extrinsic factors that dictate zonation patterns.

High-resolution cryo-EM structures offer a wealth of unexpected new insights. The catalytic F1 head rotates with the central γ -subunit for the first part of each ATP-generating power stroke. Joint rotation is enabled by subunit δ/OSCP acting as a flexible hinge between F1 and the peripheral stalk. Subunit a conducts protons to and from the c-ring rotor through two conserved aqueous channels. The channels are separated by ∼6 A˚ in the hydrophobic core of Fo, resulting in a strong local field that generates torque to drive rotary catalysis in F1. The structure of the chloroplast F1Fo complex explains how ATP synthesis is turned off at night by a redox switch. Structures of mitochondrial ATP synthase dimers indicate how they shape the inner membrane cristae.

It is still unclear if targeting mitochondrial function is a feasible therapeutic approach for the treatment of insulin resistance and glucose homeostasis. Interestingly, recent studies suggest that intact mitochondria, mitochondrial DNA, or other mitochondrial factors (proteins, lipids, miRNA) are found in the circulation, and that metabolic tissues secrete exosomes containing mitochondrial cargo. While this phenomenon has been investigated primarily in the context of cancer and a variety of inflammatory states, little is known about the importance of exosomal mitochondrial transfer in obesity and diabetes. We will discuss recent evidence suggesting that (1) tissues with mitochondrial dysfunction shed their mitochondria within exosomes, and that these exosomes impair the recipient’s cell metabolic status, and that on the other hand, (2) physiologically healthy tissues can shed mitochondria to improve the metabolic status of recipient cells.

While exercise reduced visceral adipose tissue mass, this effect of exercise was abolished in the presence of IL-6 blockade. Changes in body weight and total adipose tissue mass showed similar tendencies, whereas lean body mass did not differ between groups. Also, IL-6 blockade increased cholesterol levels, an effect not reversed by exercise.

Mitochondria fulfill key functions for cellular energy metabolism. Their biogenesis involves the import of about 1000 different proteins that are produced as precursors on cytosolic ribosomes. The translocase of the outer membrane (TOM complex) forms the entry gate for mitochondrial precursor proteins. Dedicated protein translocases sort the preproteins into the different mitochondrial subcompartments. While protein transport pathways are analyzed to some detail, only little is known about regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune protein import upon metabolic signaling. Recently, a dual role of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also termed porin, in mitochondrial protein biogenesis was reported. First, VDAC/porin promotes as a coupling factor import of carrier proteins into the inner membrane. Second, VDAC/porin regulates the formation of the TOM complex. Thus, the major metabolite channel in the outer membrane VDAC/porin connects protein import to mitochondrial metabolism.","tags":null,"title":"Mitochondrial Porin Links Protein Biogenesis to Metabolism","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maithily S.

They are essential for normal cell function by providing energy through their role in oxidizing carbon substrates. Glutathione (GSH) is a major thiol-disulfide redox buffer of the cell including the mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space. We have generated cardiomyocyte-specific Grx1-roGFP2 GSH redox potential (EGSH) biosensor mice in the past, in which the sensor is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Using this mouse model a distinct EGSH of the mitochondrial matrix (−278.9 ± 0.4 mV) in isolated cardiomyocytes is observed. When analyzing the EGSH in isolated mitochondria from the transgenic hearts, however, the EGSH in the mitochondrial matrix is significantly oxidized (−247.7 ± 8.7 mV). This is prevented by adding N-Ethylmaleimide during the mitochondria isolation procedure, which precludes disulfide bond formation. A similar reducing effect is observed by isolating mitochondria in hypoxic (0.1–3% O2) conditions that mimics mitochondrial pO2 levels in cellulo. The reduced EGSH is accompanied by lower ROS production, reduced complex III activity but increased ATP levels produced at baseline and after stimulation with succinate/ADP. Altogether, we demonstrate that oxygenation is an essential factor that needs to be considered when analyzing mitochondrial function ex vivo.","tags":null,"title":"O2 Affects Mitochondrial Functionality Ex Vivo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Fernando T.

This supports the notion that histone modifications can serve as a main cellular platform for signal integration. Hence, in this review we focus on the role of histone modifications during aging, report the data indicating that diet affects histone modification levels and explore the idea that histone modifications may function as an intersection through which diet regulates lifespan.

Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), specific for these tissues, is the key factor for heat production. Recent molecular aspects of UCP1 structure provide support for the fatty acid cycling model of coupling, i.e. when UCP1 expels fatty acid anions in a uniport mode from the matrix, while uncoupling. Protonophoretic function is ensured by return of the protonated fatty acid to the matrix independent of UCP1. This mechanism is advantageous for mitochondrial uncoupling and compatible with heat production in a pro-thermogenic environment, such as BAT. It must still be verified whether posttranslational modification of UCP1, such as sulfenylation of Cys253, linked to redox activity, promotes UCP1 activity. BAT biogenesis and UCP1 expression, has also been linked to the pro-oxidant state of mitochondria, further endorsing a redox signalling link promoting an establishment of pro-thermogenic state. We discuss circumstances under which promotion of superoxide formation exceeds its attenuation by uncoupling in mitochondria and throughout point out areas of future research into UCP1 function.","tags":null,"title":"Uncoupling Mechanism and Redox Regulation of Mitochondrial Uncoupling Protein 1 (UCP1)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mark D.

To overcome poor solubility and toxicity problems that limited the application of these compounds numerous delivering systems were used (Lila et al. in Biol Pharm Bull 37:206–211, 2014; Yue and Cao in Curr Cancer Drug Targets 16:480–488, 2016; Duan et al. in WIREs Nanomed Nanobiotechnol 8:776–791, 2016). Regarding high drug loading capacity, mesoporous silica nanoparticles like SBA-15 became more important for targeted drug delivery. In this study, cellular uptake and biological activities responsible for organotin(IV) compound ­Ph3Sn(CH2)6OH (Sn6) grafted into (3-chloropropyl)triethoxysilane functionalized SBA-15 (SBA-15p,→,SBA-15p|Sn6) were evaluated in human melanoma A375 cell line. Moreover, the influence of SBA-15p grafted with organotin(IV) compound on the stemness of A375 cell was tested. Given the fact that SBA-15p|Sn6 nanoparticles are nonspherical and relatively large, their internalization efficiently started even after 15 min with stable adhesion to the cell membrane. After only 2 h of incubation of A375 cells with SBA-15p|Sn6 passive fluid-phase uptake and macropinocytosis were observed. Inside of the cell, treatment with SBA-15p loaded with Sn6 promoted caspase-dependent apoptosis in parallel with senescence development. The subpopulation of cells expressing Schwann-like phenotype arose upon the treatment, while the signaling pathway responsible for maintenance of pluripotency and invasiveness, Wnt, Notch1, and Oct3/4 were modulated towards less aggressive signature. In summary, SBA-15p enhances the efficacy of free Sn6 compound through efficient uptake and well profiled intracellular response followed with decreased stem characteristics of highly invasive A375 melanoma cells.","tags":null,"title":"The Interaction between SBA-15 Derivative Loaded with Ph3Sn(CH2)6OH and Human Melanoma A375 Cell Line: Uptake and Stem Phenotype Loss","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shireesh Srivastava","Richard L.

The role of metabolism, and particularly of mitochondria, is increasingly being recognized as an important explanatory factor in cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Most eukaryotic cells possess a population of mitochondria, in the sense that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is held in multiple copies per cell, where the sequence of each molecule can vary. Hence, intra-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity is possible, which can induce inter-cellular mitochondrial heterogeneity, and may drive aspects of cellular noise. In this review, we discuss sources of mitochondrial heterogeneity (variations between mitochondria in the same cell, and mitochondrial variations between supposedly identical cells) from both genetic and nongenetic perspectives, and mitochondrial genotype-phenotype links. We discuss the apparent homeostasis of mtDNA copy number, the observation of pervasive intra-cellular mtDNA mutation (which is termed “microheteroplasmy”), and developments in the understanding of inter-cellular mtDNA mutation (“macroheteroplasmy”). We point to the relationship between mitochondrial supercomplexes, cristal structure, pH, and cardiolipin as a potential amplifier of the mitochondrial genotype-phenotype link. We also discuss mitochondrial membrane potential and networks as sources of mitochondrial heterogeneity, and their influence upon the mitochondrial genome. Finally, we revisit the idea of mitochondrial complementation as a means of dampening mitochondrial genotype-phenotype links in light of recent experimental developments. The diverse sources of mitochondrial heterogeneity, as well as their increasingly recognized role in contributing to cellular heterogeneity, highlights the need for future single-cell mitochondrial measurements in the context of cellular noise studies.","tags":null,"title":"Mitochondrial Heterogeneity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nikolaus Pfanner","Bettina Warscheid","Nils Wiedemann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"822b553946d10e1100536262cc3c615b","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/pfanner-2019/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.599084Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfanner-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Mitochondria are essential for the viability of eukaryotic cells as they perform crucial functions in bioenergetics, metabolism and signalling and have been associated with numerous diseases.

However, little is known about the developmental and environmental control of mitochondria in the placenta, an organ vital for fetal growth and pregnancy maintenance in eutherian mammals. Using respirometry and molecular analyses, the present study examined mitochondrial function in the distinct transport and endocrine zones of the mouse placenta during normal pregnancy and maternal inhalation hypoxia. The data show that mitochondria of the two zones adopt different strategies in modulating their respiration, substrate use, biogenesis, density, and efficiency to best support the growth and energy demands of fetoplacental tissues during late gestation in both normal and hypoxic conditions. The findings have important implications for environmentally induced adaptations in mitochondrial function in other tissues and for compromised human pregnancy in which hypoxia and alterations in placental mitochondrial function are associated with poor outcomes like fetal growth restriction.","tags":null,"title":"Placental Mitochondria Adapt Developmentally and in Response to Hypoxia to Support Fetal Growth","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Emma Lundberg","Georg H.

Quantifiable measures of skeletal muscle often include mean fiber diameter, fiber size distribution, and centrally nucleated muscle fibers. These parameters offer insights into the dynamic adaptation of skeletal muscle cells during repeated cycles of degeneration and regeneration associated with many muscle diseases and injuries. Computational programs designed to obtain these parameters would greatly facilitate such efforts and offer significant advantage over manual image analysis, which is very labor-intensive and often subjective. Here, we describe a customized pipeline termed MuscleAnalyzer for muscle histology analysis based upon CellProfiler, a free, open-source software for measuring and analyzing cell images. Results: The MuscleAnalyzer pipeline consists of loading, adjusting, and running a series of image-processing modules provided by CellProfiler. This pipeline was evaluated using wild-type and mdx muscle sections co-stained with laminin (to demarcate the muscle fiber boundaries) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, to label the nuclei). The immunofluorescence images analyzed using the MuscleAnalyzer pipeline or manually yielded similar results in the number of muscle fibers per image (p = 0.42) and central nucleated fiber (CNF) percentage (p = 0.29) in mdx mice. However, for a total of 67 images, CellProfiler completed the analysis in ~ 10 min on a regular PC while it took an investigator ~ 3 h using the manual approach in order to quantify the number of muscle fibers and CNF. Moreover, the MuscleAnalyzer pipeline also provided the measurement of the cross-sectional area (CSA) and minimal Feret’s diameter (MFD) of muscle fibers, and thus fiber size distribution can be plotted. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the MuscleAnalyzer pipeline can efficiently and accurately analyze laminin and DAPI co-stained muscle images in a batch format and provide quantitative measurements for muscle histological properties such as muscle fiber diameters, fiber size distribution, and CNF percentage.","tags":null,"title":"Automated Muscle Histopathology Analysis Using CellProfiler","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cheng-Ping Shih","Jen-Tin Lee","Hang-Kang Chen","Yi-Chun Lin","Hsin-Chien Chen","Yuan-Yung Lin","Chao-Yin Kuo","Yu-Ting Chen","Chih-Hung Wang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"575bf0d03ff1e426edb43931b8138c0f","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/shih-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.748416Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shih-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Comparison of Changes in Mitochondrial Bioenergetics between Keratinocytes in Human External Auditory Canal Skin and Cholesteatomas from Normoxia to Hypoxia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Weigert","Uwe Schmidt","Tobias Boothe","Andreas Müller","Alexandr Dibrov","Akanksha Jain","Benjamin Wilhelm","Deborah Schmidt","Coleman Broaddus","Siân Culley","Mauricio Rocha-Martins","Fabián Segovia-Miranda","Caren Norden","Ricardo Henriques","Marino Zerial","Michele Solimena","Jochen Rink","Pavel Tomancak","Loic Royer","Florian Jug","Eugene W.

This raises the question—how does the mitochondrial arrangement affect the metabolite distributions within cardiomyocytes and what is its impact on force dynamics? Here, we address this question by employing finite element modeling of cardiac bioenergetics on computational meshes derived from electron microscope images. Our results indicate that heterogeneous mitochondrial distributions can lead to significant spatial variation across the cell in concentrations of inorganic phosphate, creatine (Cr) and creatine phosphate (PCr). However, our model predicts that sufficient activity of the creatine kinase (CK) system, coupled with rapid diffusion of Cr and PCr, maintains near uniform ATP and ADP ratios across the cell cross sections. This homogenous distribution of ATP and ADP should also evenly distribute force production and twitch duration with contraction. These results suggest that the PCr shuttle and associated enzymatic reactions act to maintain uniform force dynamics in the cell despite the heterogeneous mitochondrial organization. However, our model also predicts that under hypoxia activity of mitochondrial CK enzymes and diffusion of high-energy phosphate compounds may be insufficient to sustain uniform ATP/ADP distribution and hence force generation.","tags":null,"title":"Insights on the Impact of Mitochondrial Organisation on Bioenergetics in High-Resolution Computational Models of Cardiac Cell Architecture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yuan Lu","Hisashi Fujioka","Dinesh Joshi","Qiaoyuan Li","Panjamaporn Sangwung","Paishiun Hsieh","Jiyun Zhu","Jose Torio","David Sweet","Lan Wang","Shing Yan Chiu","Colleen Croniger","Xudong Liao","Mukesh K.

Recent studies show that β 3-adrenergic receptor ( β 3-AR) is involved in tumor progression, playing an important role in metastasis. Among β -adrenergic receptors, β 3-AR is the last identified member of this family, and it is involved in cancer cell survival and induction of stromal reactivity in the tumor microenvironment. β 3-AR is well known as a strong activator of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown fat tissue. Interestingly, β 3-AR is strongly expressed in early embryo development and in many cancer tissues. Induction of uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) has been related to cancer metabolic switch, leading to accelerated glycolysis and reduced mitochondrial activity. In this study, for the first time, we demonstrate that β 3-AR is able to promote this metabolic shift in both cancer and embryonic stem cells, inducing specific glycolytic cytoplasmic enzymes and a sort of mitochondrial dormancy through the induction of UCP2. The β 3-AR/UCP2 axis induces a strong reduction of mitochondrial activity by reducing ATP synthesis and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) content. These effects are reverted by SR59230A, the specific β 3-AR antagonist, causing an increase in mtROS. The increased level of mtROS is neutralized by a strong antioxidant activity in embryonic stem cells, but not in cancer stem cells, where it causes a dramatic reduction in tumor cell viability. These results lead to the possibility of a selective antitumor therapeutic use of SR59230A. Notably, we demonstrate the presence of β 3-AR within the mitochondrial membrane in both cell lines, leading to the control of mitochondrial dormancy.","tags":null,"title":"emphβ 3-Adrenoreceptors Control Mitochondrial Dormancy in Melanoma and Embryonic Stem Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sergio González Rubio","Nuria Montero Pastor","Carolina García","Víctor G.

Reportedly, these proteins co-localize and cover the surface of the LD. To provide the spatial basis for understanding how these proteins possess their distinct roles, we examined the precise location of PLIN2 and PLIN5 and explored PLIN5 presence at LD-mitochondria contact sites using Stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy and correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM) in human skeletal muscle sections. Methods LDs were stained by MDH together with combinations of mitochondrial proteins and PLINs. Subcellular distribution and co-localization of PLIN proteins and mitochondria was imaged by STED microscopy (Leica TCS SP8) and quantified using Pearson's correlation coefficients and intensity profile plots. CLEM was employed to examine the presence of PLIN5 on mitochondria-LD contact sites. Results Both PLIN2 and PLIN5 localized to the LD in a dot-like, juxtaposed fashion rather than colocalizing and covering the entire LD. Both STED and CLEM revealed a high fraction of PLIN5 at the LD-mitochondria interface, but not at mitochondrial cristae, as suggested previously. Conclusion Using two super-resolution imaging approaches, this is the first study to show that in sections of human skeletal muscle PLIN2 and PLIN5 localize to the LD at distinct sites, with abundance of PLIN5 at LD-mitochondria tethering sites. This novel spatial information uncovers that PLIN proteins do not serve as lipolytic barriers but rather are docking sites for proteins facilitating selective lipase access under a variety of lipolytic conditions.","tags":["Lipid droplets","Mitochondria","Perilipin 2","Perilipin 5","Skeletal muscle","Super-resolution microscopy"],"title":"Super-Resolution Microscopy Localizes Perilipin 5 at Lipid Droplet-Mitochondria Interaction Sites and at Lipid Droplets Juxtaposing to Perilipin 2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Carlotta Giorgi","Saverio Marchi","Paolo Pinton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541030400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541030400,"objectID":"d73d449345d0e4e9bf43ca15e84530ef","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/giorgi-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.600865Z","relpermalink":"/publication/giorgi-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Calcium ions (Ca2+) are some of the most versatile signalling molecules, and they have many physiological functions, prominently including muscle contraction, neuronal excitability$ $, cell migration and cell growth.

Mitochondrial respiration (high-resolution respirometry), site-specific mitochondrial H2O2 emission and Ca2+ retention capacity (CRC) (spectrofluorometry) were assessed using permeabilised myofibre bundles. Electron microscopy and tomography were used to quantify mitochondrial content and investigate muscle ultrastructure. Skeletal muscle microvasculature was assessed by immunofluorescence. Results Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was significantly lower in participants with type 1 diabetes vs the control group, specifically at Complex II of the electron transport chain, without differences in mitochondrial content between groups. Muscles of those with type 1 diabetes also exhibited increased mitochondrial H2O2 emission at Complex III and decreased CRC relative to control individuals. Electron tomography revealed an increase in the size and number of autophagic remnants in the muscles of participants with type 1 diabetes. Despite this, levels of the autophagic regulatory protein, phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPKαThr172), and its downstream targets, phosphorylated Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1 (p-ULK1Ser555) and p62, was similar between groups. In addition, no differences in muscle capillary density or platelet aggregation were observed between the groups.

Cells not only detect environmental temperature changes through their unique temperature-sensitive molecular machineries but also muster an appropriate response to the temperature change to maintain their inherent functions. Despite the fundamental involvement of temperature in physiological phenomena, the mechanism by which cells produce and use heat is largely unknown. Recently, fluorescent thermosensors that function as thermometers in live cells have attracted much attention in biology. These new tools, made of various temperaturesensitive molecules, have allowed for intracellular thermometry at the single-cell level. Intriguing spatiotemporal temperature variations, including organelle-specific thermogenesis, have been revealed with these fluorescent thermosensors, which suggest an intrinsic connection between temperature and cell functions. Moreover, fluorescent thermosensors have shown that intracellular temperature changes at the microscopic level are largely different from those assumed for a water environment at the macroscopic level. Thus, the employment of fluorescent thermosensors will uncover novel mechanisms of intracellular temperature-assisted physiological functions.","tags":null,"title":"Intracellular Thermometry with Fluorescent Sensors for Thermal Biology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yiming Li","Markus Mund","Philipp Hoess","Joran Deschamps","Ulf Matti","Bianca Nijmeijer","Vilma Jimenez Sabinina","Jan Ellenberg","Ingmar Schoen","Jonas Ries"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"2d8a7aa89df4838803afacd19392886e","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/li-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.824844Z","relpermalink":"/publication/li-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Real-Time 3D Single-Molecule Localization Using Experimental Point Spread Functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mir Anwar","Amy Saldana-Caboverde","Sofia Garcia","Francisca Diaz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1525132800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525132800,"objectID":"f71f2c36f3e307fe8e36f5b48d4eb5ca","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/anwar-2018/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.69236Z","relpermalink":"/publication/anwar-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"We examine the effect of oxidative stress on the stability of mitochondrial respiratory complexes and their association into supercomplexes (SCs) in the neuron-specific Rieske iron sulfur protein (RISP) and COX10 knockout (KO) mice. Previously we reported that these two models display different grades of oxidative stress in distinct brain regions. Using blue native gel electrophoresis, we observed a redistribution of the architecture of SCs in KO mice. Brain regions with moderate levels of oxidative stress (cingulate cortex of both COX10 and RISP KO and hippocampus of the RISP KO) showed a significant increase in the levels of high molecular weight (HMW) SCs. High levels of oxidative stress in the piriform cortex of the RISP KO negatively impacted the stability of CI, CIII and SCs. Treatment of the RISP KO with the mitochondrial targeted antioxidant mitoTEMPO preserved the stability of respiratory complexes and formation of SCs in the piriform cortex and increased the levels of glutathione peroxidase. These results suggest that mild to moderate levels of oxidative stress can modulate SCs into a more favorable architecture of HMW SCs to cope with rising levels of free radicals and cover the energetic needs.","tags":null,"title":"The Organization of Mitochondrial Supercomplexes Is Modulated by Oxidative Stress In Vivo in Mouse Models of Mitochondrial Encephalopathy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Eric M.

Many popular methods, such as antibody labeling, are used to add physical fluorescent labels to specific cellular constituents. However, these approaches have significant drawbacks, including inconsistency; limitations in the number of simultaneous labels because of spectral overlap; and necessary perturbations of the experiment, such as fixing the cells, to generate the measurement. Here, we show that a computational machine-learning approach, which we call ‘‘in silico labeling’’ (ISL), reliably predicts some fluorescent labels from transmitted-light images of unlabeled fixed or live biological samples. ISL predicts a range of labels, such as those for nuclei, cell type (e.g., neural), and cell state (e.g., cell death). Because prediction happens in silico, the method is consistent, is not limited by spectral overlap, and does not disturb the experiment. ISL generates biological measurements that would otherwise be problematic or impossible to acquire.","tags":null,"title":"In Silico Labeling: Predicting Fluorescent Labels in Unlabeled Images","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Travers Ching","Daniel S.

Here, we report that constriction by the division machinery does not ensure mitochondria will divide. Instead, potential division sites accumulate molecular components and can constrict before either dividing, or relaxing back to an unconstricted state. Using time-lapse structured illumination microscopy (SIM), we find that constriction sites with higher local curvatures – reflecting an increased membrane bending energy – are more likely to divide. Furthermore, analyses of mitochondrial motion and shape changes demonstrate that dividing mitochondria are typically under an externally induced membrane tension. This is corroborated by measurements using a newly synthesized fluorescent mitochondrial membrane tension sensor, which reveal that depolymerizing the microtubule network diminishes mitochondrial membrane tension. We find that under reduced tension, the number of constrictions is maintained, but the probability that constrictions will divide is concomitantly reduced. These measurements allow us to establish a physical model, based on in situ estimates of membrane bending energy and tension, which accounts for the observed fates of mitochondrial constriction events.","tags":null,"title":"Membrane Bending Energy and Tension Govern Mitochondrial Division","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dominique Chrétien","Paule Bénit","Hyung-Ho Ha","Susanne Keipert","Riyad El-Khoury","Young-Tae Chang","Martin Jastroch","Howard T.

Mitochondria are major actors in this thermogenic process. Part of the energy released by the oxidation of respiratory substrates drives ATP synthesis and metabolite transport, but a substantial proportion is released as heat. Using a temperature-sensitive fluorescent probe targeted to mitochondria, we measured mitochondrial temperature in situ under different physiological conditions. At a constant external temperature of 38 ˚C, mitochondria were more than 10 ˚C warmer when the respiratory chain (RC) was fully functional, both in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and primary skin fibroblasts. This differential was abolished in cells depleted of mitochondrial DNA or treated with respiratory inhibitors but preserved or enhanced by expressing thermogenic enzymes, such as the alternative oxidase or the uncoupling protein 1. The activity of various RC enzymes was maximal at or slightly above 50 ˚C. In view of their potential consequences, these observations need to be further validated and explored by independent methods.

Among them, the existing inflammatory process may lead to an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress, in turn, can trigger mitochondrial changes, which is called mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, excess nutrients supply (as it commonly is the case with obesity) can overwhelm the Krebs cycle and the mitochondrial respiratory chain, causing a mitochondrial dysfunction, and lead to a higher ROS formation. This increase in ROS production by the respiratory chain may also cause oxidative stress, which may exacerbate the inflammatory process in obesity. All these intracellular changes can lead to cellular apoptosis. These processes have been described in obesity as occurring mainly in peripheral tissues. However, some studies have already shown that obesity is also associated with changes in the central nervous system (CNS), with alterations in the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and in cerebral structures such as hypothalamus and hippocampus. In this sense, this review presents a general view about mitochondrial dysfunction in obesity, including related alterations, such as inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis, and focusing on the whole organism, covering alterations in peripheral tissues, BBB, and CNS.","tags":null,"title":"Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Obesity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Juliette Griffié","Leigh Shlomovich","David J.

One hypothesis is that MBIs reverse expression of genes involved in inflammatory reactions that are induced by stress. This systematic review was conducted to examine changes in gene expression that occur after MBIs and to explore how these molecular changes are related to health. We searched PubMed throughout September 2016 to look for studies that have used gene expression analysis in MBIs (i.e., mindfulness, yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong, relaxation response, and breath regulation). Due to the limited quantity of studies, we included both clinical and non-clinical samples with any type of research design. Eighteen relevant studies were retrieved and analyzed. Overall, the studies indicate that these practices are associated with a downregulation of nuclear factor kappa B pathway; this is the opposite of the effects of chronic stress on gene expression and suggests that MBI practices may lead to a reduced risk of inflammation-related diseases. However, it is unclear how the effects of MBIs compare to other healthy interventions such as exercise or nutrition due to the small number of available studies. More research is required to be able to understand the effects of MBIs at the molecular level.","tags":null,"title":"What Is the Molecular Signature of Mind–Body Interventions?

Similar to brown fat, beige adipocytes are assumed to express mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and are thermogenic due to the UCP1-mediated H+ leak across the inner mitochondrial membrane. However, this assumption has never been tested directly. Herein we patch clamped the inner mitochondrial membrane of beige and brown fat to provide a direct comparison of their thermogenic H+ leak (IH). All inguinal beige adipocytes had robust UCP1-dependent IH comparable to brown fat, but it was about three times less sensitive to purine nucleotide inhibition. Strikingly, only $15% of epididymal beige adipocytes had IH, while in the rest UCP1-dependent IH was undetectable. Despite the absence of UCP1 in the majority of epididymal beige adipocytes, these cells employ prominent creatine cycling as a UCP1-independent thermogenic mechanism.","tags":null,"title":"Mitochondrial Patch Clamp of Beige Adipocytes Reveals UCP1-Positive and UCP1-Negative Cells Both Exhibiting Futile Creatine Cycling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dusanka Milenkovic","James N.

Active BAT is present in adult humans and its activity is impaired in patients with obesity. The ability of BAT to protect against chronic metabolic disease has traditionally been attributed to its capacity to utilize glucose and lipids for thermogenesis. However, BAT might also have a secretory role, which could contribute to the systemic consequences of BAT activity. Several BAT-derived molecules that act in a paracrine or autocrine manner have been identified. Most of these factors promote hypertrophy and hyperplasia of BAT, vascularization, innervation and blood flow, processes that are all associated with BAT recruitment when thermogenic activity is enhanced. Additionally, BAT can release regulatory molecules that act on other tissues and organs. This secretory capacity of BAT is thought to be involved in the beneficial effects of BAT transplantation in rodents. Fibroblast growth factor 21, IL-6 and neuregulin 4 are among the first BAT-derived endocrine factors to be identified. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of the regulatory molecules (the so-called brown adipokines or batokines) that are released by BAT that influence systemic metabolism and convey the beneficial metabolic effects of BAT activation. The identification of such adipokines might also direct drug discovery approaches for managing obesity and its associated chronic metabolic diseases.","tags":null,"title":"Brown Adipose Tissue as a Secretory Organ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Audrey Sambeat","Olga Gulyaeva","Jon Dempersmier","Hei Sook Sul"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"f5bae751f2f0490981a6e2f741f0d407","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/sambeat-2017/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.640257Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sambeat-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Epigenetic Regulation of the Thermogenic Adipose Program","type":"publication"},{"authors":["V.

The indirect parameter to assess the functional state of mitochondria in cells is the degree of their fragmentation, i.e., the ratio of long or branched mitochondrial structures to round mitochondria. Such evaluations requires an approach that allows to create an integral pattern of the three-dimensional organization of mitochondrial reticulum using confocal images of mitochondria stained with a fluorescent probe. In the present study, we tested three approaches to analyzing the structural architecture of mitochondria under normal conditions and fission induced by oxidative stress. We revealed that, while the most informative is a three-dimensional reconstruction based on series of confocal images taken along the Z-dimension, with some restrictions it is plausible to use more simple algorithms of analysis, including one that uses unitary twodimensional images. Further improvement of these methods of image analysis will allow more comprehensive study of mitochondrial architecture under normal conditions and different pathological states. It may also provide quantification of a number of mitochondrial parameters determining the morphofunctional state of mitochondria—primarily, their absolute and relative volumes—and give additional information on threedimensional organization of the mitochondrion.","tags":null,"title":"Quantification of Mitochondrial Morphology in Situ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vera Kozjak-Pavlovic"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"8846c3d93afeb814f137c1188a9181b8","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/kozjak-pavlovic-2017/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.815612Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kozjak-pavlovic-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Mitochondria are organelles of endosymbiotic origin, surrounded by two membranes.

Mitochondrial diseases are the most common group of inherited metabolic disorders and are among the most common forms of inherited neurological disorders. One of the challenges of mitochondrial diseases is the marked clinical variation seen in patients, which can delay diagnosis. However, advances in next-generation sequencing techniques have substantially improved diagnosis, particularly in children. Establishing a genetic diagnosis allows patients with mitochondrial diseases to have reproductive options, but this is more challenging for women with pathogenetic mtDNA mutations that are strictly maternally inherited. Recent advances in in vitro fertilization techniques, including mitochondrial donation, will offer a better reproductive choice for these women in the future. The treatment of patients with mitochondrial diseases remains a challenge, but guidelines are available to manage the complications of disease. Moreover, an increasing number of therapeutic options are being considered, and with the development of large cohorts of patients and biomarkers, several clinical trials are in progress.","tags":null,"title":"Mitochondrial Diseases","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dae In Kim","Kyle J.

In the genomic era, more than 50 previously unknown MCs from these organisms have been identified and characterized biochemically using a method consisting of gene expression, purification of the recombinant proteins, their reconstitution into liposomes and transport assays (EPRA). Information derived from studies with intact mitochondria, genetic and metabolic evidence, sequence similarity, phylogenetic analysis and complementation of knockout phenotypes have guided the choice of substrates that were tested in the transport assays.

Their shapes depend on both a cell's type and its physiological state. Staining with a cationic fluorescent dye, tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM), unveiled intriguing details of lamellar structure, consisting of rapidly changeable, curtain-like formations. The TMRM-positive structure colocalized with neither proteins in the matrix nor on the outer membrane, but partially localized with the nucleoid. Suppression of a component in the mitochondrial contact site disrupted the lamellar TMRM-positive structure. Uncoupling of the oxidative phosphorylation system released TMRM from the inner membrane without any alteration in the matrix structure. STED images further showed that complexes of the electron transport chain are located on the surface of TMRM-positive structures.

Proposed models include entrapment in nanoscale noncontiguous domains found in PtK2 cells, slow diffusion due to crowding, and actin-induced compartmentalization. Here, by applying single-particle tracking at high time resolutions, mainly to the PtK2-cell PM, we found confined diffusion plus hop movements (termed “hop diffusion”) for both a nonraft phospholipid and a transmembrane protein, transferrin receptor, and equal compartment sizes for these two molecules in all five of the cell lines used here (actual sizes were cell dependent), even after treatment with actin-modulating drugs. The cross-section size and the cytoplasmic domain size both affected the hop frequency. Electron tomography identified the actin-based membrane skeleton (MSK) located within 8.8 nm from the PM cytoplasmic surface of PtK2 cells and demonstrated that the MSK mesh size was the same as the compartment size for PM molecular diffusion. The extracellular matrix and extracellular domains of membrane proteins were not involved in hop diffusion. These results support a model of anchored TM-protein pickets lining actin-based MSK as a major mechanism for regulating diffusion.","tags":null,"title":"Confined Diffusion of Transmembrane Proteins and Lipids Induced by the Same Actin Meshwork Lining the Plasma Membrane","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pooja Jha","Xu Wang","Johan Auwerx"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1456790400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1456790400,"objectID":"cb218f76059916543a5e447e2dc4ecd4","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/jha-2016/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.759832Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jha-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Analysis of Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Supercomplexes Using Blue Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (BN-PAGE): BN-PAGE to Study Mitochondrial Respiratory Chain Supercomplexes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John M.

Furthermore, the largely proprietary composition of reagents in commercial kits means that the user is not able to make adjustments if, for example, a particular component affects the activity of a protein of interest. The method described here allows the isolation of purified proteins from three cellular fractions: the cytosol, membrane-bound organelles, and the nucleus.

How do we gain insight into the dynamic processes of disease and development from terabytes of multidimensional image data? Here I describe a collaborative approach to extracting meaning from biological imaging data. The collaboration consists of teams of biologists and engineers working together. Custom computational tools are built to best exploit application-specific knowledge in order to visualize and analyze large and complex data sets. The image data are summarized, extracting and modeling the features that capture the objects and relationships in the data. The summarization is validated, the results visualized, and errors corrected as needed. Finally, the customized analysis and visualization tools together with the image data and the summarization results are shared. This Perspective provides a brief guide to the mathematical ideas that rigorously quantify the notion of extracting meaning from biological image, and to the practical approaches that have been used to apply these ideas to a wide range of applications in cell and tissue optical imaging.","tags":null,"title":"Extracting Meaning from Biological Imaging Data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yalei Chen","Nathan C.

One example of such a complex is the cellulose synthesis complex (CSC), which in plants synthesizes cellulose, the most abundant biopolymer on Earth. In growing plant cells, CSCs exist in the plasma membrane as six-lobed rosettes that contain at least three different cellulose synthase (CESA) isoforms, but the number and stoichiometry of CESAs in each CSC are unknown. To begin to address this question, we performed quantitative photobleaching of GFP-tagged AtCESA3containing particles in living Arabidopsis thaliana cells using variable-angle epifluorescence microscopy and developed a set of information-based step detection procedures to estimate the number of GFP molecules in each particle. The step detection algorithms account for changes in signal variance due to changing numbers of fluorophores, and the subsequent analysis avoids common problems associated with fitting multiple Gaussian functions to binned histogram data. The analysis indicates that at least 10 GFP-AtCESA3 molecules can exist in each particle. These procedures can be applied to photobleaching data for any protein complex with large numbers of fluorescently tagged subunits, providing a new analytical tool with which to probe complex composition and stoichiometry.","tags":null,"title":"Molecular Counting by Photobleaching in Protein Complexes with Many Subunits: Best Practices and Application to the Cellulose Synthesis Complex","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chuankai Zhou","Brian D.

Here, we show that in asymmetrically dividing yeast cells, aggregation of cytosolic misfolded proteins does not occur spontaneously but requires new polypeptide synthesis and is restricted to the surface of ER, which harbors the majority of active translation sites. Protein aggregates formed on ER are frequently also associated with or are later captured by mitochondria, greatly constraining aggregate mobility. During mitosis, aggregates are tethered to well-anchored maternal mitochondria, whereas mitochondria acquired by the bud are largely free of aggregates. Disruption of aggregatemitochondria association resulted in increased mobility and leakage of mother-accumulated aggregates into the bud. Cells with advanced replicative age exhibit gradual decline of aggregates-mitochondria association, likely contributing to their diminished ability to rejuvenate through asymmetric cell division.","tags":null,"title":"Organelle-Based Aggregation and Retention of Damaged Proteins in Asymmetrically Dividing Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Valerie Coffman","I-Ju Lee","Jian-Qiu Wu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409529600,"objectID":"d0ec4b205546600eb4cf0727844b41b8","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/coffman-2014/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.802119Z","relpermalink":"/publication/coffman-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Counting Molecules Within Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Greg Wilson","D.

We found that, in mitochondria isolated from the inguinal ‘‘white’’ adipose depot of cold-acclimated mice, UCP1 protein levels almost reached those in brown-fat mitochondria. The UCP1 was thermogenically functional, in that these mitochondria exhibited UCP1-dependent thermogenesis with lipid or carbohydrate substrates with canonical guanosine diphosphate (GDP) sensitivity and loss of thermogenesis in UCP1 knockout (KO) mice. Obesogenic mouse strains had a lower thermogenic potential than obesity-resistant strains. The thermogenic density (UCP1-dependent oxygen consumption per g tissue) of inguinal white adipose tissue was maximally one-fifth of interscapular brown adipose tissue, and the total quantitative contribution of all inguinal mitochondria was maximally one-third of all interscapular brown-fat mitochondria, indicating that the classical brown adipose tissue depots would still predominate in thermogenesis.","tags":null,"title":"UCP1 in Brite/Beige Adipose Tissue Mitochondria Is Functionally Thermogenic","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

In contrast, trimethylation at lysine 4 was 40% higher in adipocytes from overweight diabetic subjects compared with normal-weight and overweight non-diabetic subjects.

Their ability to fuse and divide provides functional and morphological flexibility and is a key feature in mitochondrial quality maintenance. To study the impact of mitochondrial fusion/fission on the reorganization of inner membrane proteins, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes in mitochondria of different HeLa cells were tagged with fluorescent proteins (GFP and DsRed-HA), and cells were fused by polyethylene glycol treatment. Redistribution of the tagged OXPHOS complexes was then followed by means of immunoelectron microscopy, two color super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and single molecule tracking. In contrast to outer membrane and matrix proteins, which mix quickly and homogeneously upon mitochondrial fusion, the mixing of inner membrane proteins was decelerated. Our data suggest that the composition of cristae is preserved during fusion of mitochondria and that cristae with mixed OXPHOS complexes are only slowly and successively formed by restricted diffusion of inner membrane proteins into existing cristae. The resulting transitory mosaic composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane illuminates mitochondrial heterogeneity and potentially is linked to local differences in function and membrane potential.","tags":null,"title":"Restricted Diffusion of OXPHOS Complexes in Dynamic Mitochondria Delays Their Exchange between Cristae and Engenders a Transitory Mosaic Distribution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anna Sawicka","Christian Seiser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351728000,"objectID":"0e6734b469145461bc29566764b1a1a9","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/sawicka-2012/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.641056Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sawicka-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Post-translation modifications of histones modulate the accessibility and transcriptional competence of specific chromatin regions within the eukaryotic genome. Phosphorylation of histone H3 is unique in the sense that it associates on one hand with open chromatin during gene activation and marks on the other hand highly condensed chromatin during mitosis. Phosphorylation of serine residues at histone H3 is a highly dynamic process that creates together with acetylation and methylation marks at neighboring lysine residues specific combinatorial patterns that are read by specific detector proteins. In this review we describe the importance of different histone H3 phosphorylation marks for chromatin condensation during mitosis. In addition, we review the signals that trigger histone H3 phosphorylation and the factors that control this reversible modification during interphase and mediate the biological readout of the signal. Finally, we discuss different models describing the role of histone H3 phosphorylation in the activation of transcription of poised genes or by transient derepression of epigenetically silenced genes. We propose that histone H3 phosphorylation in the context with lysine methylation might temporarily relieve the silencing of specific genes without affecting the epigenetic memory.","tags":null,"title":"Histone H3 Phosphorylation – A Versatile Chromatin Modification for Different Occasions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["R.

However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that mitochondria are intimately involved in cell signalling pathways. Mitochondria perform various signalling functions, serving as platforms to initiate cell signalling, as well as acting as transducers and effectors in multiple processes. Here, we discuss the active roles that mitochondria have in cell death signalling, innate immunity and autophagy. Common themes of mitochondrial regulation emerge from these diverse but interconnected processes. These include: the outer mitochondrial membrane serving as a major signalling platform, and regulation of cell signalling through mitochondrial dynamics and by mitochondrial metabolites, including ATP and reactive oxygen species. Importantly, defects in mitochondrial control of cell signalling and in the regulation of mitochondrial homeostasis might underpin many diseases, in particular age-related pathologies.","tags":null,"title":"Mitochondria and Cell Signalling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Dimauro","Timothy Pearson","Daniela Caporossi","Malcolm J Jackson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"2458dc41d2c8db60e1dd6fe15777d65d","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/dimauro-2012/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.585047Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dimauro-2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Background: We describe a method for subcellular fractionation of mouse skeletal muscle, myoblast and myotubes to obtain relatively pure fractions of nuclear, cytosolic and mitochondrial compartments. Fractionation allows the analysis of a protein of interest (or other cellular component) based on its subcellular compartmental distribution and can also generate molecular information about the state of a cell and/or tissue and how the distribution of a protein may differ between different cellular compartments, tissues or cell types, in response to treatments or ageing. Findings: The described method was specifically developed for skeletal muscle and proliferating/differentiated muscle cells. The purity of the different fractions, representing the cytoplasmic, mitochondrial and nuclear subcellular compartments was validated by western blot analysis of “house-keeper” marker proteins specific for each cellular compartment. Conclusion: This low cost method allowed the mitochondrial, cytoplasmic and nuclear subcellular compartments from the same starting muscle samples to be rapidly and simultaneously isolated with good purity and without the use of an ultracentrifuge. This method permits samples to be frozen at −80°C for future analysis and/or additional processing at a later date.","tags":null,"title":"A Simple Protocol for the Subcellular Fractionation of Skeletal Muscle Cells and Tissue","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Douglas W.

Mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 in brown fat cells produces heat by dissipating the energy generated by fatty acid and glucose oxidation. In addition to thermogenesis and despite its small relative size, sympathetically activated BAT constitutes an important glucose, fatty acid, and triacylglycerol-clearing organ, and such function could potentially be used to alleviate dyslipidemias, hyperglycemia, and insulin resistance. To date, chronic sympathetic innervation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) γ activation are the only recognized inducers of BAT recruitment. Here, we review the major differences between these two BAT inducers in the regulation of lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, lipid uptake and triacylglycerol synthesis, glucose uptake, and de novo lipogenesis. Whereas BAT recruitment through sympathetic drive translates into functional thermogenic activity, PPARγ-mediated recruitment is associated with a reduction in sympathetic activity leading to increased lipid storage in brown adipocytes. The promising therapeutic role of BAT in the treatment of hypertriglyceridemic and hyperglycemic conditions is also discussed.","tags":null,"title":"Control of Brown Adipose Tissue Glucose and Lipid Metabolism by PPARγ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus Islinger","Ka Wan Li","Maarten Loos","Sven Liebler","Sabine Angermüller","Christoph Eckerskorn","Gerhard Weber","Afsaneh Abdolzade","Alfred Völkl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"c21ac782e397f9080098fc76a7af0e4e","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/islinger-2010/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.587849Z","relpermalink":"/publication/islinger-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Peroxisomes from the Heavy Mitochondrial Fraction: Isolation by Zonal Free Flow Electrophoresis and Quantitative Mass Spectrometrical Characterization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mariusz R Wieckowski","Carlotta Giorgi","Magdalena Lebiedzinska","Jerzy Duszynski","Paolo Pinton"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1257033600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1257033600,"objectID":"ed1dad6225ecbbebdaf513a183fc4359","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/wieckowski-2009/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.590809Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wieckowski-2009/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Isolation of Mitochondria-Associated Membranes and Mitochondria from Animal Tissues and Cells","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Francisca Dï¿½ï¿½az","Antoni Barrientos","Flavia Fontanesi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1254355200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1254355200,"objectID":"5c5a776acf7c89ba5890508352b35d1d","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/di-1-2-i-1-2-az-2009/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.761478Z","relpermalink":"/publication/di-1-2-i-1-2-az-2009/","section":"publication","summary":"The oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system consists of five multimeric complexes embedded in the mitochondrial inner membrane.

The existence of a spatially stable subplasmalemmal domain of high-polarized mitochondria in the mature oocyte and early embryo is proposed to form a microzone of differential activity that may locally influence the normality of fertilization. High-polarized mitochondria may also influence developmentally significant activities in the peri-implantation blastocyst and differentiating embryonic stem cell.

These indicator dyes are lipophilic cations accumulated by mitochondria in proportion to ⌬⌿. Upon accumulation, all three dyes exhibit a red shift in both their absorption and fluorescence emission spectra. The fluorescence intensity is quenched when the dyes are accumulated by mitochondria. These properties have been used to develop a method to dynamically monitor ⌬⌿ of isolated rat heart mitochondria using a ratio fluorescence approach. All three dyes bound to the inner and outer aspects of the inner mitochondrial membrane and, as a result, were accumulated by mitochondria in a greater quantity than predicted by the Nernst equation. Binding to mitochondria was temperature-dependent and the degree of binding was in the order of TMRE Ͼ R123 Ͼ TMRM. The internal and external partition coefficients for binding were determined to correct for binding in the calculation of ⌬⌿. All three dyes suppressed mitochondrial respiratory control to some extent. Inhibition of respiration was greatest with TMRE, followed by R123 and TMRM. When used at low concentrations, TMRM did not suppress respiration. The use of these dyes and ratio fluorescence techniques affords a simple method for measurement of ⌬⌿ of isolated mitochondria. We also applied this approach to the isolated perfused heart to determine whether ⌬⌿ could be monitored in an intact tissue. Wavelength scanning of the surface fluorescence of the heart under various conditions after accumulation of TMRM indicated that the mitochondrial matrix-induced wavelength shift of TMRM also occurs in the heart cytosol, eliminating the use of this approach in the intact heart.","tags":null,"title":"Measurement of Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Using Fluorescent Rhodamine Derivatives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.M.

Significantly, however, quantitative data on how energy transduction might be regulated or perturbed by the physiological state of the cell has only been gathered via indirect studies on isolated mitochondrial suspensions; quantitative studies on individual mitochondria in situ have not been possible because of their small size, their intrinsic motility, and the absence of appropriate analytical reagents. In this article, we combine techniques for rapid, high resolution, quantitative three-dimensional imaging microscopy and mathematical modeling to determine accurate distributions of a potentiometric fluorescent probe between the cytosol and individual mitochondria inside a living cell. Analysis of this distribution via the Nernst equation permits assignment of potentials to each of the imaged mitochondrial membranes. The mitochondrial membrane potentials are distributed over a narrow range centered at -150 mV within the neurites of differentiated neuroblastoma cells. We find that the membrane potential of a single mitochondrion is generally remarkably stable over times of 40-80 s, but significant fluctuations can occasionally be seen. The motility of individual mitochondria is not directly correlated to membrane potential, but mitochondria do become immobile after prolonged treatment with respiratory inhibitors or uncouplers. Thus, three spatial dimensions, a key physiological parameter, and their changes over time are all quantitated for objects at the resolution limit of light microscopy. The methods described may be readily extended to permit investigations of how mitochondrial function is integrated with other processes in the intact cell.","tags":null,"title":"Imaging in Five Dimensions: Time-Dependent Membrane Potentials in Individual Mitochondria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["D.L.

The essential attributes of these dyes include membrane permeability, low membrane binding, spectral properties which are insensitive to environment, and, of course, strong fluorescence. A series of dyes were screened on HeLa cells for their ability to meet these criteria and several commercially available dyes were found to be satisfactory. In addition, two new dyes were synthesized for this work by esterification of tetramethyl rhodamine. The analysis of the measured fluorescent intensities requires correction for fluorescence collected from outside the plane of focus of the cell and for nonpotentiometric binding of the dye. The measurements and analysis were performed on three different cell types for which there exists a body of literature on membrane potential; the potentials determined in this work were always within the range of literature values. The rhodamine esters are nontoxic, highly fluorescent dyes which do not form aggregates or display binding-dependent changes in fluorescence efficiency. Thus, their reversible accumulation is quantitatively related to the contrast between intracellular and extracellular fluorescence and allows membrane potentials in individual cells to be continuously monitored.","tags":null,"title":"Membrane Potential Can Be Determined in Individual Cells from the Nernstian Distribution of Cationic Dyes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anis Karmali","David J.

The accumulation of these cations by mitochondria is described by an uptake and binding to the matrix face of the inner membrane in addition to the binding to the cytosolic face of the inner membrane. The apparent partition coefficients between the external medium and the cytosolic surface of the inner membrane (K'o) and the internal matrix volume and matrix face of the inner membrane (K~) were determined and were utilized to estimate the membrane potential Atp from the cation accumulation factor Rc according to the relation Ar = R T / Z F In [(RcVo - K',~)/( Vi + K~)] where Vo and V; are the volume of the external medium and the mitochondrial matrix, respectively, and Rc is the ratio of the cation content of the mitochondria and the medium. The values of A~bestimated from this equation are in remarkably good agreement with those estimated from the distribution of 86Rb in the presence of valinomycin. The results are discussed in relation to studies in which the membrane potential in mitochondria and bacterial cells was estimated from the distribution of lipophilic cations.","tags":null,"title":"Membrane Potential and Surface Potential in Mitochondria: Uptake and Binding of Lipophilic Cations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Werner Schreiner","Claude Villee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":-149990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-149990400,"objectID":"23d7cd5b61a731f8b3648848e96c6e26","permalink":"https://cembio.github.io/publication/schreiner-1965/","publishdate":"2020-02-12T14:50:37.625145Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schreiner-1965/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Oxidative Phosphorylation in Mitochondria from Human Placentas","type":"publication"}]
